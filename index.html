      <ol>
        <li>Coffee Culture</li>
        <p>
          One of the liveliest and colourful cafes in Mumbai. With two fine
          outlets across the city, Coffee Culture is your go-to when in doubt.
          The quirky ambiance, polite service and great coffee will make up for
          your gloomy day.

        <li>Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters</li>
        <p>
          This is an organic and ethically made coffee shop. They roast their
          coffee in-house and the vibes in here in lovely. The wafting aroma of
          coffee in the air is perfectly paired with a cute quaint shop
        </p>
        <p>
          Blue Tokai serve amazing cold brew and cappuccinos in town. Don’t
          forget to try their Almond Croissant and Danish as well.

        <li>Tea Villa Cafe</li>
        <p>
          A very clean and well lit shop that will drive away those Monday
          blues. It has a bunch of locations in the city. Despite the
          tea-focused name, we promise they have amazing coffee. With a whooping
          13 page beverage menu, you know you can’t go wrong. Order a charcoal
          latte for something different.

        <li>Poetry by Love and Cheesecake</li>
        <p>
          Where do we begin? Artsy, colourful and straight out of a dream.
          Poetry by Love and Cheesecake is a gorgeous cafe that demands
          attention.

        <li>The Pantry</li>
        <p>
          With a farm to fork approach, The Pantry Cafe celebrates healthy
          living. It’s located conveniently at Kala Ghoda, the rightful art
          district in town. All bakery items are baked fresh at the cafe and the
          produce is locally sourced.
